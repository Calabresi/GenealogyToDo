Per Carmela Calabrese's death certificate, she was unmarried.
Math says Antonia Romeo was born in 1882 in Reggio Cal. There are five volumes of Atti di Nascita for that year, none of which are indexed. Checking the master index below...
Nati, indici decennali 1876-1885 Reggio Calabria:
- There is an Antonino de Antonio record 1436 born in 1882, check the actual record
-- Yes, Antonino de Antonio, not what I'm looking for
- Same, record 60
-- Antonina but with the wrong mother
- Same, born 1881, record 832 or 932
-- 832 was someone else
--- benvanrijswijk.com insists 832 is Antonio, checking again
---- yeah, it's Angiolo Bagnalo
-- so is 932. Gonna have to reverify that index number
- Same, 204
-- This is for Antonio, son of Antonino and Antonia (Marra). Not confusing at all.
-- These are the only four records I could find in the indici decennali
- Benvanwhatsit.com also indicated an Antonio de Antonino in 83, and that appears to be the correct person I'm looking for, although I did goof with the mother's maiden name; it's Toscano, not Moscano
Antonia Romeo's death record is in the 1954 stato civile death record number 295, but that's not online yet.
There do not appear to be stato civile birth indexes online for 1908 and 1912 yet.
Domenico Calabresi di Pietro ed Antonia Romeo in Maria SS. del Rosario Baptisms 1879-1913, number 303
-- recheck that number, it's not 303 but the page is damaged
Carmela Calabresi di Pietro e Antonia Romeo 671
-- recheck this number too, it's not 671
--- trying 621
--- it was 694. I don't know how it was 694. But it is.
