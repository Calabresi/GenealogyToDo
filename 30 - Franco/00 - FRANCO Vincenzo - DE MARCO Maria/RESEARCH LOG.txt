Vincenzo was born in 1818 or *very* late 1817 in Reggio Cal per his death record. I've checked the Reggio Calabria Stato Civile for 1818 supplements 2 and 3, which are solely indexed names, but the "regular" record is unindexed and I have not gone through that.
While we know Vincenzo's parents' names, we do not have DOB for either of them and do not have a DOB for Vincenzo either.
